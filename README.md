Welcome cat lovers!
Seeking out your perfect fluffy roommate? Well, look no further, this will help you choose amoung dozens and dozens breeds.

The app UI was inspired by Tinder, one of the most popular dating app in the world. 

The main flow stays the same: swipe right if you like the cat or swipe left if you're looking for another one.

You can shuffle your card deck.

You can check out your favourites.

You can adjust your search by adding filters (such as "dog-friendly", "child-friendly" and many more).
